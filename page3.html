    <h3>Venice</h3>
    <p>There's nowhere on Earth quite like Venice: Its canals, labyrinth 
        f car-free cobblestone streets, and hidden passageways are perfect 
        for wandering. Hail a water taxi or gondola to wind through the 
        city and, if you have time, get out of the historic center and 
        head for the outer islands.</p>

    <img src=ROME.png>
    <h3>Rome</h3>
    <p>Rome captivates travelers in ways few cities can—chalk it up to 
        world-class architecture, impossibly narrow cobblestone vicoli, 
        and museums filled with artistic masterpieces. Call us sentimental, 
        but we still stop dead in our tracks at the first glimpse of the 
        Pantheon.</p>

    <img src=MASCAT.jpeg>
    <h3>Mascat</h3>
    <p>Oman has some of the most spectacular landscapes, from beaches 
        to fantastically craggy mountain ranges. Meanwhile, Muscat, 
        Oman’s port capital, is hemmed in by mountains and deserts on 
        the Gulf of Oman, where 21st-century shopping malls share space 
        with 16th-century Portuguese forts and gleaming mosques.</p>

    <img src=PARIS.jpeg>
    <h3>Paris</h3>
    <p>This one's a given, right? Paris is a place where romance and 
        history play side by side. Cafés line cobblestone streets, 
        beautiful people stroll along the Seine at all hours, and every 
        neighborhood seems to have its own iconic landmark, be it the Notre 
        Dame, Sacré-Coeur, or Eiffel Tower.</p>
