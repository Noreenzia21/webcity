    <h3>Venice</h3>
    <p>There's nowhere on Earth quite like Venice: Its canals, labyrinth 
        f car-free cobblestone streets, and hidden passageways are perfect 
        for wandering. Hail a water taxi or gondola to wind through the 
        city and, if you have time, get out of the historic center and 
        head for the outer islands.</p>

    <img src=rome.png>
    <h3>Rome</h3>
    <p>Rome captivates travelers in ways few cities can—chalk it up to 
        world-class architecture, impossibly narrow cobblestone vicoli, 
        and museums filled with artistic masterpieces. Call us sentimental, 
        but we still stop dead in our tracks at the first glimpse of the 
        Pantheon.</p>

    <h3>Mascat</h3>
    <p>Oman has some of the most spectacular landscapes, from beaches 
        to fantastically craggy mountain ranges. Meanwhile, Muscat, 
        Oman’s port capital, is hemmed in by mountains and deserts on 
        the Gulf of Oman, where 21st-century shopping malls share space 
        with 16th-century Portuguese forts and gleaming mosques.</p>

    <img src=paris.jpeg>
    <h3>Paris</h3>
    <p>This one's a given, right? Paris is a place where romance and 
        history play side by side. Cafés line cobblestone streets, 
        beautiful people stroll along the Seine at all hours, and every 
        neighborhood seems to have its own iconic landmark, be it the Notre 
        Dame, Sacré-Coeur, or Eiffel Tower.</p>

    <img src=london.jpeg>
    <h3>London</h3>
    <p>London is one of the most vibrant cities in the world, with 
       history (Westminster Abbey) and models of modernity (London Eye, 
       The Gherkin) mingling on the Thames. Art and literature seem to 
       seep out of the city's walls—and in recent years, London has 
       glammed up even more, with contemporary art galleries and boutique 
       retailers adding some glimmer to formerly seedy areas.</p>
    
    <img src=istanbul.webp>
    <h3>Istanbul</h3>
    <p>Istanbul continues to draw us in, whether it's through the 
    frenetic opulence of the Grand Bazaar or the old-meets-new aesthetic 
    of Karaköy. But the architecture still shines brightest here, with 
    the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia featuring prominent displays of both 
    Byzantine and Ottoman styles: Think massive domes, colored mosaics, minarets, 
    and Islamic calligraphy.</p>

    <img src=sawat.jpeg>
    <h3>Sawat</h3>
    <p>Swat District is a district in the Malakand Division of Khyber 
       Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. With a population of 2,309,570 per the 
       2017 national census, Swat is the 15th-largest district of 
       Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.</p>

    <h3>Tokyo</h3>
    <p>Tokyo, Japan’s busy capital, mixes the ultramodern and the traditional, 
       from neon-lit skyscrapers to historic temples. The opulent Meiji Shinto 
       Shrine is known for its towering gate and surrounding woods. The Imperial 
       Palace sits amid large public gardens. The city's many museums offer exhibits 
       ranging from classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed 
       kabuki theater</p>

    <img src=singapour.jpeg>
    <h3>Singapour</h3>
    <p>Singapore is a superlative city, with elaborate temples, extraordinary 
        gardens, and world-class architecture (check out the candy-colored 
        houses on Koon Seng Road). The beauty here is both natural and man-made, 
        with travelers seeking out the city's tropical jungle in the Botanic 
        Garden and the wild, technicolor Gardens by the Bay. As an added bonus, 
        you can reach everything via some of the cleanest streets and subways 
        we've ever seen.</p>
